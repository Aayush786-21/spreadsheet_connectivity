Google Sheets Task Processor
Google Sheets Task Processor is a Python-based application that automates the processing of tasks in a Google Spreadsheet. The application reads tasks, conditions, and user inputs, processes them according to predefined rules, and writes the results back into the spreadsheet.

Features
Google Sheets Integration: Connect seamlessly to Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.
Automated Task Processing: Read and process tasks based on user-defined conditions.
Dynamic Output: Write the output directly back to the Google Spreadsheet.
Modular Design: Easily expandable and maintainable code structure.
Future Plans
Google Developer Platform Integration: Explore the possibility of using the Google Developer platform for API credentials instead of Google Cloud.
Testing & Validation: Conduct extensive testing to validate the use of the Google Developer platform as a viable alternative to Google Cloud for spreadsheet connectivity.
Prerequisites
Python: Python 3.x
Google Cloud Setup: A Google Cloud Project with Sheets API and Drive API enabled.
Libraries:
gspread
oauth2client
Service Account: A credentials JSON file from a Google Cloud service account.
